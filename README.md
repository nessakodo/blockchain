# Encode Blockchain Bootcamp -- Lesson Compilation

This is a repository I've created for the sake of keeping everything in one place. Note that each branch is it's own lesson, as guided by the master [repo](https://github.com/Encode-Club-Solidity-Bootcamp) where you can further find issues other students have created as we all are on the path to learning the fundamentals of blockchain development. 

The files above are generated by following the instructions given in Lesson 5, creating a basic hardhat project with a few commands you can find in the original README.md
